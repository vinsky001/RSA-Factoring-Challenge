WHAT IS rsa?

rsa is a computer program that implements the RSA algorithm. It is entirely 
written in standard C++ (the 1998 version), using only the standard libraries. 
There are a lot of implementations of RSA out there, and some are even 
open-source and very popular (OpenSSL). The goal for rsa is to be complete and 
easy to understand. 'Complete' means that the entire functionality of the RSA 
algorithm (including encryption, decryption, key generation and digital 
signature) should be implemented. rsa is licensed under the GPLv3 software 
license <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. 

WHAT IS THE RSA ALGORITHM?

The RSA algorithm is a cryptography algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt 
information (messages, files etc.) or for digital signing. You can find out more
